# Mixed Num

No-STD abstraction layer enabling numerical functions to be implemented once, and simultaneously support both real and complex numbers with, int, fixed and floating point types.

The library supplies complex structs `Polar<T>` and `Cartesian<T>` with no-std implementation of math traits, including `MixedNum` traits.

Some interoperability with num::Complex is implemented.

This is an experimental library.

This library support fixed point numbers using the [fixed](https://crates.io/crates/fixed) crate.
It uses [num](https://crates.io/crates/num) for floating point generics.
